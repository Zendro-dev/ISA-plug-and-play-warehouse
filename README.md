# ISA Plug & Play Zendro Data Warehouse
This repository holds a Plug & Play [Zendro](https://zendro-dev.github.io/) instance populated with [ISA](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) data model definitions. It is also customized to enable file attachments via a [minio](https://min.io/) fileserver as well as special handling of images through an [imgproxy](https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy) server.

This is thought of as a local Sandbox that can be quickly setup on any local machine through docker. If you want to put the whole setup into production some minimal configuration is needed in the `docker-compose` yaml file as well as the environment files (see below).

## Prerequisites
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

Download or clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Zendro-dev/ISA-plug-and-play-warehouse
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be done via the .env files in the separate sub-repositories (`graphql-server`, `single-page-app` and `graphiql-auth`).

There are `.env.example` files included that can be used by simply removing the `.example` extension. They should work out of the box as is.

### Database configuration (Advanced)
In case you want Zendro to talk to other databases that can be configured in `config/data_models_storage_config.json`.
## Start up
Start up the docker containers via:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans 

```
This will fetch all the necessary docker images and install them as well as starting up the containers. The containers will be avaialable at:

```
graphql-server: http://localhost:3000/graphql
graphiql: http://localhost:7000
single-page-app: http://localhost:8080
keycloak: http://10.5.0.11:8081
minio: http://localhost:9000
imgproxy: http://localhost:8082
```

## Shut down
Stop the docker containers via
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml down
```
In case you want to also delete the local docker volumes with your data run
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml down -v
```

## Creating the Minio Buckets

By default this setup uses 2 separate minio buckets to hold image and other data. The names of the buckets can be controlled via environment variables. The defaults are:
```
IMG_BUCKET_NAME = "images";
FILES_BUCKET_NAME = "files";
```

Those need to be created manually in the minio admin surface at

```
http://localhost:9000
```

You can login to the minio client via:

```
username: minio
password: miniominio
```

_**Note:**_ This step can probably be automated in the future.

## Keycloak admin console (Advanced)

In case there is some manual configuration needed (like adding different identity providers) for keycloak, the admin console is reachable at:
```
http://10.5.0.11:8081
```
You can login via:
```
username: admin
password: admin
```

## Access the graphql server from the console

To access the graphql-server from the console simply
```
curl http://localhost:3000/help
```
to get information on how to get an access_token and how to use it to access the server with simple http requests via `curl`. This is of course directly applicable to any other script like e.g `python`,

## Plots
In the Sandbox an example of how to supply a simple plot to the SPA. To make the plot work a table is include in the repository in `data`, that can be added as a `data` record for example through the single-page-app interface.
- click on data at the left hand menu
- Add new record by clicking the `+` icon
- Add the record and attach the file `data/20220127_Analysis_Tomato_both_cpm_merged.csv`

After adding the record clicking on the `Plots` Menu in the Topbar should render a bar plot of Gene-expression counts for a specific Tomato genes under different conditions.

The data used is published and accessible at
```
Reimer JJ, Thiele B, Biermann RT, Junker-Frohn LV, Wiese-Klinkenberg A, Usadel B, et al. Tomato leaves under stress: a comparison of stress response to mild abiotic stress between a cultivated and a wild tomato species. Plant Mol Biol. 2021;107: 177â€“206.
```
## Manual customization
Every sub-repoistory is fully customizable by simply changing the code and restarting the docker-compose.
